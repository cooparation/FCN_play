# FCN-ResNet50

This is a Fully Convolutional Networks(FCN), which is based on ResNet50, for Semantic Segmentation. I have fine tuned this net with VOC2012 train set, horizontal flip for data augmentation.

I tried to change the filter size in fc6 from 1\*1 to 7\*7 with padding 3. But there was no improvement.
I guess the reason is that I reduced the number of filters in fc6 and fc7. I will not fix it, but you can still reference this code for your experiment. 

Good luck!
